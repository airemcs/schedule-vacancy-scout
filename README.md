# Schedule Vacancy Scout

The Schedule Vacancy Scout is an experimental Java program that aids in both recreational and professional circumstances. It is focused on bringing together and organizing these open time periods to facilitate hangouts and gatherings. It requires users to input different weekly schedules and it will automatically determine the timeslots of which the parties are uniformly available. This could serve purposes from setting meetings up to simply hanging out with friends.

## Inspiration

The vision for this curiosity or project  developed after I finished my university's trimestral enlistment of classes. I wanted to share my final weekly schedule to my friends and vice versa, so I could see the timeslots of which both of us would be free to hangout together. As the schedules piled up, the harder it was to track manually and mentally - hence, I wanted to create a program that automated this process.

## Roadmap

- [X] Create a Git repository.
- [X] Install JavaFX for the GUI.
- [X] Establish VMC the folder structure.
- [ ] Create the necessary models required.
- [ ] Ensure the controllers and models communicate properly.
- [ ] Finish the final revisions.

> I feature I would love to implement in the future would be a method of which users would upload a screenshot of their academic schedule instead of inputting them manually to the program's database. (8/30/23)
